# Main.py

This is a FastAPI server that includes routers for various endpoints and middleware for handling CORS requests.

## Usage

To run the server, execute the following command:

```
uvicorn main:app --reload
```

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can access the various endpoints by navigating to the appropriate URL. For example, to access the `accounts` endpoint, you would navigate to `http://localhost:8000/accounts`.

## Endpoints

The server includes the following endpoints:

- `/auth` - handles authentication and generates JWT tokens
- `/accounts` - handles CRUD operations for user accounts
- `/ai` - handles AI-related operations
- `/projects` - handles CRUD operations for AI projects
- `/image` - handles image-related operations

Each endpoint is defined in a separate router module located in the `routers` directory.

## Middleware

The server includes a middleware function for handling CORS requests. This middleware allows requests from the following origins:

- http://localhost
- http://localhost:8000
- http://localhost:3000
- http://localhost:27017

In addition to the CORS middleware, the server includes a middleware function for adding CORS headers to responses.

## Requirements

This script requires Python 3.x and the following packages to run:

- fastapi
- uvicorn

You can install these packages using the following command:

```
pip install fastapi uvicorn
```

# Authenticator.py

This module defines a custom `Authenticator` class for handling authentication and authorization in a FastAPI application.

## Usage

To use the `MyAuthenticator` class in your application, you can create an instance of the class with your signing key and use it as a dependency in your FastAPI endpoints.

For example, to protect an endpoint with authentication, you can use the `Authenticator` instance as a dependency like this:

```python
from fastapi import Depends, FastAPI
from authenticator import MyAuthenticator
from queries.accounts import AccountQueries

app = FastAPI()
authenticator = MyAuthenticator("my-signing-key")

@app.get("/protected")
async def protected_route(
    account: AccountOut = Depends(authenticator.get_current_account),
):
    # Only authenticated users can access this route
    return {"message": f"Hello, {account.email}!"}
```

In this example, the `protected_route` endpoint is protected by the `Authenticator` instance. The `get_current_account` method of the `MyAuthenticator` class is used as a dependency to retrieve the current user's account data.

## Dependencies

The `MyAuthenticator` class depends on the `AccountQueries` class from the `queries.accounts` module to retrieve account data from the database. This dependency is injected into the `MyAuthenticator` class using the `Depends` function from the `fastapi` module.

## Methods

The `MyAuthenticator` class defines several methods for handling authentication and authorization:

- `get_account_data`: retrieves account data from the database based on the user's email address
- `get_account_getter`: returns the `AccountQueries` instance for use as a dependency in FastAPI endpoints
- `get_hashed_password`: retrieves the hashed password value from an `AccountOut` object
- `get_account_data_for_cookie`: retrieves the user's email and account data for use in a JWT cookie

## Configuration

The `MyAuthenticator` class requires a signing key to be passed in as a parameter when creating an instance of the class. This key should be stored in an environment variable for security purposes, as shown in the example code:

```python
import os
from authenticator import MyAuthenticator

authenticator = MyAuthenticator(os.environ["SIGNING_KEY"])
```

## Requirements

This module requires Python 3.x and the following packages to run:

- fastapi
- jwtdown-fastapi

You can install these packages using the following command:
